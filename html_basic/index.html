        <h1>My first coding experience</h1>
        <P>I never thought that i would one day be a programmer, it never came close to my dreams. 
         i always thought i was going to be dancer or a photographer but here i am today sharing 
         my first coding experience. stay with me as i put you through my coding journey.
        </P>
        <h2> The start of my coding journey</h2>
        <h3>and creating my first web page</h3>
        <P>I was priviledge to begin such an interesting, stressful, time draining but <strong> YES</strong>an amazing
         journey by ALX. It is indeed the best opprtunity given to me so far. i got to know of them from my big sister
         who wants nothing but the best for me. A friend of hers posted it on her status and she made enquires from him 
         concerning the program, then she sent a message to me and toldme to look into it and guess what i signed up the 
         next day and after some weeks I got accepted
        </p>
         <p>Once I was accepted a welcome party was held. i attented online because the venue was lagos and i cou;dnt make
          it to lagos but it was an amazing, inspiring, eduacating and a bindlowing event, it changed my mindset and helped 
          me organise my thoughts. later on the onboarding session began, i got loggrd in to thr inyranet, i met some peers
          i formed a peer learning group and the members of the group have een so supportive to each other. we put ourselves
          through the first and seccond weeks project and we keep pushing hoping to graduate together.
         </p>
         <p>The process of creating a web page has not been fuuny, i had to watch lots of videos and read many articles. then 
            i had to practice.first i opened a repository on github and create a directory and a file. this things have me a 
            headache in the previous tasks eventually i was able to do it. 
         </p>
